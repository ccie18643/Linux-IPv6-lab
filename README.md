# Linux IPv6 lab

With this project i would like to achieve three goals.
- Implement lightweight network lab solution based solely on Linux network namespaces and OVS.
- Learn more about IPv6 operations by examining packet exchange captures of various IPv6 mechanisms.
- Get better understanding of OSPFv3 protocol.
